Food and drinks are often categorized by the &#10;amount of calories they have. For example, an apple typically holds 95 &#10;calories while a pepperoni and cheese pizza from Pizza Hut will typically &#10;hold 250-380 calories. Your body needs calories for energy, but eating too &#10;many calories may lead to weight gain if you do not burn enoughcalories &#10;through exercise. &#10;&#10;Macronutrients, or macros, are a list of nutrients that are bodyneeds on a &#10;daily basis to maintain good health. The 3 nutrients that I will focus on &#10;within this application are carbohydrates, protein, and fats. Carbohydrates &#10;are the main energy source of your body. Protein allows your body to grow &#10;and build/repair tissues which comes in handy when you have sore muscles &#10;or have some type of injury. Fat allows you to store energy, but consuming &#10;the wrong type of fat too much can lead to weightgain. " />
